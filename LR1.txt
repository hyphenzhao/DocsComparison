IntroductionBrain Computer Interface(BCI), also known as Brain Machine Interface(BMI), is a technology that can connect the brain to computers without peripheral neural system [1]. The history of BCI can be traced back to 1929 when the first time Hans Berger published his discovery - the Electroencephalography (EEG) [1]. Since a BCI system can directly send instructions from brain to the computer, it may be more helpful for disabled people to regain their lost abilities. Besides, people with disorders, for example, cerebral palsy (CP), should also be beneficial from this technology. Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders caused by the damage on part of the brain in one person’s early age [2]. It is reported that the incidence of cerebral palsy in Australia is about 2.1‰ [3]. According to the previous research, 25% of cerebral palsy people do not have the ability to talk and one in three is unable to walk [2]. It is believed that the expenditure of cerebral palsy was up to 1.47 billion in 2007 in Australia [4]. It is essential for both of the society and the individuals to facilitate the rehabilitation of cerebral palsy people with serious disorders. A BCI system could be a compensation of cerebral palsy people’s lost abilities. Besides the explicit abilities, a BCI system could potentially help to evaluate CP people’s intelligence development [5]. However, the researches focused on BCI application in cerebral palsy are limited. It should be very beneficial to review current BCI applications and the limitations in terms of cerebral palsy.2. Brain Computer InterfaceA conventional BCI system includes a group of sensors, an amplifier or an analogue signal processing module and a computer with BCI software and drivers. There are plenty of options regarding to every part of BCI system. A few of reviews have sufficiently evaluated some of these technologies. Nonetheless, this review will additionally introduce some recently invented technologies and append comments in the context of cerebral palsy.2.1 Brain Signals Acquiring MethodsThere are various acquiring methods of brain signals. In order to know the context of the different brain signals, a brief description of the mechanism of central neural system will be firstly demonstrated here. Generally, our daily activities are directed or affected by both of electrical signals and chemical signals [6]. Our thoughts and feelings are generated by neurons in our brain [6]. And those signals can be transmitted through neurons in either electrical or chemical format [6]. When some parts of our brain are getting active, the change of our brain either in an electric way or a chemical way will be detected through various methodologies. There are plenty of methods could be used to monitor the status of the brain. However, since the BCI needs a continuous wearing, considering about the safety and healthy issues, the ionizing methods are not suitable in this case. Besides ionizing methods, there are still lots of harmless methods available to be considered as the BCI sensor options. Basically, these non-ionizing methods can be divided into two types: invasive methods or non-invasive methods.The invasive methods are fairly intuitive. Since electricity is generated in brain, it is also possible to be detected in brain. One of the way to implement this is to implant electrodes directly into the brain grey matters. The advantage is that the signals are very clear. There were heaps of researches have done experiments on animals [7], however the human experiments are limited due to ethic issues [8]. It could be concluded as the most accurate measuring method in respect to its time and spatial resolution [9]. On the other hand, the drawbacks are also obvious in this method. There is a high risk of infection while implanting the electrodes [8]. Besides, the electrodes can induce immune response which will increase the impedance of the implanting surface in grey matters and reduce the signal quality [7] [9]. This means that those electrodes need to be adjusted after a long time wearing. It is inconvenient and dangerous for the users. Another invasive method is Electrocorticography (ECoG). Instead of inserting electrodes in the brain, it will put a grid of electrodes on the outside of the cortex [10]. This will decrease the possibility of infection and immune response [11]. The user can use it longer than the intra-cortical method safely and stably [10]. Nevertheless, the sensors still need brain surgery to be implanted into the users’ brains [10]. It still has infection potentials. Consequently, all the invasive methods expose users to a potentially risky situation. Additionally, the spatial coverage of invasive methods is limited by the health issues [9]. Since the invasive methods has a significant defect, the non-invasive methods could be a better option for a daily use. There are plenty of activities in our brain which will cause physical changes that could be detected at the outside of heads. There are quite a few technologies that measure the electrical, magnetic and metabolic changes on the head. The most popular method used in BCI area is EEG. It measures the electrical changes on the scalp. The EEG signal on the head was firstly discovered by Hans Berger in 1924 [12]. In over decades researches, it has been the main method used in the BCI system. It is also a very useful tool in clinical diagnose [13]. Conventionally, the EEG electrodes will be placed according to an international 10-20 EEG system map. Different EEG signal frequencies have different features and may indicate different brain activities or status [13]. The details of this method including utilizations in BCI system will be described in the following chapter.Figure 1. International 10-20 EEG System [14]Table 1.

Basically, EEG measures electric currents leaked out from the brain neurons. These currents will also generate magnetic field which can be measured outside of brain by MEG technology. The MEG signal has a similar pattern compared with EEG signal [7]. It is  emphasised that the MEG has a better performance than EEG with regard to the temporal and spatial resolution [15]. The difference is that MEG signal is more sensitive to the influences from neural activity instead of skull and scalp [16]. However, in order to make MEG sensors achieve a certain accuracy, a cumbersome accessory equipment will be needed to improve the conductivity and reduce the magnetic interferences from the environment [7]. This feature will significantly reduce the portability of MEG equipment. Brain activities are actually electric and chemical reactions over neurons, which needs energy provided by blood. In fact, the activated part of the brain should have a change in blood-oxygen-level [17]. Based on this truth, a BCI can use this metabolic change as an input signal [18]. fMRI utilize the nuclear magnetic resonance of hydrogen atoms in the brain fluid [19]. In order to make a clearer resonance, a strong magnetic field, around 0.2T – 7T, is needed [20] [21]. This strong magnetic field could cause uncomfortable feelings to the users [22]. Moreover, the long term impact of strong magnetic environment is unknown [23]. fNIRS is another technology measures the metabolic activities in the brain. It uses near-infrared light to monitor the changes of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin which indicates the blood-oxygen-level in the brain [7]. Compared with fMRI, it is much cheaper and has less side effects on the human body [24]. Its weakness is that the spatial resolution and the penetration depth are not satisfactory as fMRI. There are several researches have tried to apply fMRI and fNIRS to be BCI input methods [24] [25]. However, the major issue of metabolic measurements is the poor temporal resolution ascribed to the nature of latency in hemodynamic response [26].Table 2.

Our brains generate and transfer signals in some certain patterns. Understanding these patterns will help us build up a feasible interaction protocol between humans and computers. These patterns can be categorized in different ways. In this chapter, the BCI signal types will be illustrated from two perspectives.2.2.1 Based on Signal FeaturesBased on the features of signals, the BCI signals can be classified as Event-Related Desynchronization or Synchronization (ERD/ERS), Event Related Potentials/Fields (ERP/ERF), Slow Cortical Potentials (SCP) and Steady State Evoked Potentials (SSEP).ERD refers to a phenomenon which is the amplitude decreases in some certain signal rhythms [27]. Conversely, ERS refers to the amplitude enhancement of some certain signal rhythms [27]. ERD in alpha and beta rhythms usually means an activation of the corresponding brain area and the present of ERS in these two rhythms usually means deactivation [27] [28]. ERS in gamma rhythm has an opposite meaning. The gamma rhythm ERS implies the corresponding brain part is in a rest or relax status []. These features of brain might be utilized to be input command indicators in the BCI system. ERD/ERS does not need any simulation, which makes it more intuitive and less tiring. However, it requires mind training of users. Users have to practice to obtain the ability of creating ERD/ERS readable imaginations []. Besides, natures of ERD/ERS limited the input commands could be only 3-4 types []. ERP analyses the potential changes of the brain when it responses to the certain stimulus. The similar method in MEG is called ERF []. In general, there will be a potential or magnetic field shift after the brain receives a stimulus []. The stimulus could either from a physical stimulus or an imaginary one []. There will be a series of potential fluctuations after the stimulus, including negative and positive changes []. The most frequently used in a BCI system is called P300 which is a positive peak shown at around 300ms after the stimulus []. It is a relatively stable response to the stimulus, which makes it more practicable in the BCI system. ERP has strengths of no pre-trainings and short response time []. Still, the amplitude of ERP signals is low, which makes the signal-noise-ratio relatively low []. The latency and scale of the potential shift depends on the individuals []. It may need a suitable algorithm to address differences. Furthermore, inappropriate selection of stimulus may cause fatigue to users [].As the name suggests, SCP is a slow EEG voltage shift originated from the upper cortical [http://biofeedbackfederationofeurope.blogspot.com/2014/04/introduction-to-slow-cortical.html]. It could last from 300ms to over 1 sec, which are pretty slow in a neural system context []. Initially, the user should be trained with intuitive stimulus to obtain the skills of actively generating the SCP signals []. The training time is highly based on individual learning ability []. Therefore, it is recommended to be adapted to patients at an early stage of a developing neural disease []. The accuracy of SCP method is practically proven to be acceptable [120-122 from BCILiteraturalReview]. On the other hand, due to its nature of relative high latency, the Information Transfer Rate (ITR) is not as good as other methods. Additionally, the training time is actually longer than others which may take up to several months.A truth is that the major frequency of EEG signals will change corresponding to the stimulus frequency []. Based on this feature, several SSEP BCI systems were developed []. Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEP) is the most popular method since it could provide more operation choices and a higher ITR. The user could make selection by focusing on their desired option flashing in a certain frequency [IEEECIM09]. This is also called f-VEP which means VEP based on frequency differences [IEEECIM09]. There are also two other VEP types named t-VEP and c-VEP [IEEECIM09]. Time modulated VEP will flush exactly one option at a time, which limited its ITR [IEEECIM09]. The optimal option will be pseudo-random VEP [IEEECIM09]. It will encode options with different flushing sequence. A proper selection of flushing frequency and sequence combination will significantly optimize the ITR. According to a research in 2015, the largest ITR BCI was actually achieved by c-VEP method [Chen X, Wang Y, Nakanishi M, et al. High-speed spelling with a non-invasive brain–computer interface[J]. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2015, 112(44): E6058-E6067]. Nonetheless, SSVEP needs continuous attention from users which may cause tiredness [Multi?command SSAEP?based BCI system with training sessions for SSVEP during an eye fatigue state]. There are also several researches tried to utilize auditory signals as an evoked input [].Table 3.

It is the most frequently used method in a context of the BCI system. The main detecting area of visual BCI are from occipital and parietal regions. Besides, frontal regions are also another interested area in visual P300 detection. As it is also described as tired of using visual stimulus [], auditory could be another competitive stimuli method []. Auditory BCI system is found to be promised and effective []. In a most recent research, it is reported that mental repeating of sound stimulus is also possible []. It is proved that mental repeating will contribute to a decrease of fatigue []. It is argued in another research that tactile evoked BCI has a better performance than visual and auditory ones [Comparison of tactile, auditory, and visual modality for brain-computer interface use: a case study with a patient in the locked-in state]. Visual, auditory and tactile signals are commonly used in SSEP, ERP/ERF and SCP. Meanwhile, ERD/ERS BCIs are basically based on sensorimotor signals. In fact, imagery motor is more frequently used as people who need BCI always have different degrees of movement incapable. Besides single source, there are more and more researches proposed to use a hybrid signal sources. It is implied in Zander et al.’s research [27], that combined BCI with eye gaze could improve the inclusiveness of a touchless control system. In another study, EEG and EMG are combined together as signal source to classify upper-limb movement intentions [28]. On the one hand, EOG could be treated as an interference when collecting EEG signals; on the other hand, it could help to improve the accuracy of interpreting users’ intentions [29].2.3 EEG ElectrodesAs the EEG acquiring method is more convenient and safer. It is currently widely utilized in the BCI design. Hence, EEG Electrodes will be particularly introduced here. EEG Electrodes could be divided into three types: passive electrodes, active-dry electrodes and active-wet electrodes. Passive electrodes usually refer to those pure electrodes without embedded electrical circuit to pre-process the original signal. It usually needs paste or gel to remove the horniness on the scalp. Generally, the paste/gel of passive electrodes will need a few minutes to absorb horniness and settle down the resistance. This will increase calibration time of the system and leave sticky materials on the hair. This feature has been complained a lot by users. Although it is not as convenient as dry electrodes, it is normally less expensive and more conductive than active electrodes. Active electrodes are those embedded with signal amplifier. It could actively increase the volume of signals with minimum data loss. It is a trade-off to make active electrodes more comfortable or more accurate. It is implicated that active-wet electrodes have better performance than dry ones [30]. However, it is also pointed out that those active-dry electrodes are good enough in terms of being a BCI input option [30].2.4 Signal Processing and ClassificationBefore the BCI signals are actually classified, there will be some pre-processing method to eliminate noise and improve signal-noise-ration (SNR) of the original ones. A digital filter could be a good option to filter out unnecessary signals. The filter shape should be determined by the proposed BCI method. Another algorithm that are frequently used to pre-process the raw data is called primary component analysis (PCA). This algorithm will reduce the workload of following classification algorithm and improve the latter’s performance. After the pre-processing, the data will be analysed, classified and mapped to a BCI command. Traditionally, single vector machine (SVM) is always used as a classifier ascribed to its simplicity and efficiency. Another similar method is kth-nearest-neighbours. It is also an easy and efficient algorithm. Both of them could achieve an accuracy from 57% - 99% [31]. A more complicated algorithm is neural network which is also a famous machine learning algorithm. Its performance is not promised to be enhanced, compared to the simpler linear classifier, with its complexity increased [32].Another comprehensive signal processing and classification method should be mentioned here is BCI2000. BCI2000, an open-source project which integrated multiple kinds of BCI data processing algorithms, was established by Schalk et al. in 2004 [33]. It is being continuously maintained by programmers and researchers all over the world. It also covers almost all currently commercialised amplifiers. 3. BCI for People with Cerebral Palsy 3.1 BCI Applications for Cerebral PalsyThe most frequently used BCI application for general situations is the speller to satisfy the communication needs of people who lost their speaking ability and have no other options to interact with computers [7]. It is also regarded as the first BCI application in publications [34]. It is not designed specifically for people with cerebral palsy but it also could be used for them. The previous research has shown a fairly reasonable accuracy of people with cerebral palsy utilizing row-column speller (RC Speller) [35]. Another research has also proposed a lateral single character speller which could improve the ITR and accuracy [36].Besides communication needs, a more common BCI application scenario for cerebral palsy is the cognitive evaluation. A cognitive assessment for people with cerebral palsy is essential especially for those in an early age [37]. In some cases, BCI could be the only accessible option to help them finish the test [38]. In 1995, Joseph et al. have already shown an optimistic result of using ERP as a BCI signal to evaluate the language ability of children with cerebral palsy [39].As mentioned before in this article, some BCI requires a training for users to obtain the skills of generating a correct brain signal. This part could be tedious. A game application was introduced by Scherer et al. to improve the attractiveness of BCI training [40].3.2 Challenges of BCI Applications for People with Cerebral PalsyIn the history of BCI utilization for people with cerebral palsy, there are quite a few considerable problems mentioned in several publications. The most obvious problems of people with cerebral palsy using BCI is the involuntary movement. It is reported as problem in many of the BCI for cerebral palsy researches [34] [41] [5]. Additionally, supportive devices for people with cerebral palsy will cause a difficulty of placing EEG electrodes in a perfect position [35]. Some of BCI options may also need motor imaginary. These types of BCI could be not suitable to people with cerebral palsy as part of them may have lost their certain motor ability since a very young age [42]. They may have difficulty of recreating right imaginary [42]. Moreover, the brain damage of cerebral palsy may cause a decrease of the motor imaginary signal strength which will obstruct the BCI classification [43]. Besides signal quality itself, cerebral palsy may also lead to a different intra-brain correlation that will influence the classification of BCI signals [44]. 4. ConclusionBrain computer interface, a novel technology, could help people in different ways. People with serious disabilities might be significantly benefited from this technology. Cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder, should also be positively aided by it. However, the utilizations are very limited due to the brain damage of cerebral palsy. In addition, the BCI applications for people with cerebral palsy seems to be less considered than locked-in syndrome (LIS). As a result, the BCI uses in more area including cerebral palsy should be more emphasized as this technology should contribute more to the improvement of the world.5. Bibliography[1] J. J.
